Comments:

The basic interaction techniques (grabbing, locomotion) were already implemented in the assignments.

The spatial menus for teleportation were reasonable and worked well.

The 3D minimap was not interactive, so it was unclear what purpose this would serve.  It would potentially be useful if the user could teleport using the minimap.

The triangle manipulation technique was designed for use on touch surfaces, such as multitouch workbench or tablet.  This did not seem to be a good choice for fully immersive VR, as there are spatial interaction techniques that would work better in three dimensions.
